Build a new calendar tool, with a robust system of rearrangable blocks which will reorient based upon deferrals, and require you to check in after every task to see if you successfully completed it, need more time, etc; events roll over to the next day, highest priority are set first on the schedule, you can have exclusion zones into which events will not clip, and shorter events will arange around to fill the time surrounding, and tasks will lengthen or shorten slightly to accomodate surroundings. This should act as a solution for time\mutable personal tasks which you do not want to assign an exact time to, as plans like this get derailed easily, and can be a pain in the ass.
