Agora - for user- and platform- created votes, wherein we can extrapolate global and community-wide support using (AI or statistical methods?)
Beacon - Broad aggregate feed of AI news, courtesy of some existing AI news platform, probably (Definitely so in MVP, as implementing that whole thing immediately would be stupid) (register each user a parallel account for that service and use its api)
Chorus - Shortform takes and long essays by community members, allowing for sorting by cultural sector/etc. and, optionally, using an AI to summarize the general sentiment (with heavy disclaimers and bayesian aggreement metrics) of both the general public and a specific filtered group in a given timespan

Make timelines of sentiments toward different ideas (by NLP) and polls over time.

ALL USER DEMOGRAPHIC DATA IS STRICTLY PRIVATE, ONLY USED IN MAKING BROAD EXTRAPOLATIONS

Require all users to be authenticated as humans (somehow check that all users are human)

In some later, post-mvp version, implement a system of renown, awarded for giving highly-appreciated takes (especially for controversial, highly-appreciated takes), voting, and generally being active in the community. Renown gives certain voting and design perks, similarly to the CodeWars system.

Perhaps voting is zero-sum, and so votes work like aggreement-tokens: you earn them from garnering votes from others, and can then spend them to boost others' takes through tips. Spending permanently boosts visibility of a post, even once you've spent the tokens you earned from it.

Be aggressively public-oriented, aiming to get the broadest cross-section of the public possible.
